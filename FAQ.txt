1. Why the data type and expiary time not considered in the memory calculation "_calculate_memory_usage()" method ?
It only tracked key and value.

2. In delete method, we are not checking for expiry time...so will del method work regardless of the expire time.

3. In ttl why we are not checking is_key_valid().....

4. get data type and get type.

5. Uptime in seconds correct? its just giving time.time()

6. In command execute method all the codes count+=1 happening even before its executed..

7. select.select....read kongula ar write kongula.....
